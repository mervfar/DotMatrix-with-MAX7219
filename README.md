<b>This code repo is explaining how to wire your 8x8 DotMatrix with the controller MAX7219 circuit..</b>


<h1>All you have to need is;</h1>

<h3>1.Any Arduino MCU</h3>

<h3>2.MAX7219 chip</h3>

<h3>3.DotMatrix Module</h3>



First you might check your DotMatrix module so as you can find out  some documentation about pinout or data-sheet.

The module " DotMatrix " in this project has 8x8 pins..

The pin diagram and MAX7219 wiring schema is uploaded in the code section.
Also there is 2 shared library file that we can use..
<b>Same pin wiring for each libraries</b>

<h2>Have fun with your projects..</h2>
